# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and
# are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more about the API, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
#
# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as
# booleans: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`. Therefore, these strings
# must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

            * URI pattern: Construct a subject URI starting with http://〜 or namespace:〜 (the namespace name must be registered in the &quot;Namespaces&quot; setting).<br />
            * URI column: Treat values of a specified column as subject URIs (Use only if cell values of a specified column are already stored as URIs).

            [Required]<br />
            * URI pattern: Specify to construct an object URI based on the cell's value using a special variable @@table_name.column_name@@ (e.g., to make ID as a URI by adding prefix).<br />
            * URI column: Specify to treat the cell's value as an object URI.<br />
            * Literal pattern: Specify to customize a literal value including the cell's value using a special variable @@table_name.column_name@@ (e.g., to add unit string to numbers).<br />

        object_datatype:
          html: |-
            [Optional] Specify a datatype URI (e.g., xsd:integer) to be added for generating an object literal with a datatype (e.g., 123^^xsd:integer)

          html: |-
            [Optional] If the condition evaluates to TRUE for a SQL result set row, then triples will be generated from that row.
